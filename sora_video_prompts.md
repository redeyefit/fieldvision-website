### Prompt Option 1: "The Transformation"

Cut to: He holds up his phone and speaks naturally, as if recording a voice note. His expression shifts from tired to relieved.

Cut to: Close-up of an iPhone screen showing a clean, professional daily report appearing with smooth animations - weather data, bullet points of work completed, organized sections.

Cut to: Wide shot of the superintendent smiling, putting his phone away, and driving off from the jobsite toward a beautiful sunset. Text overlay fades in: "Get home 30 minutes earlier."

### Prompt Option 2: "Voice to Report" (Simpler)
```
Close-up of a construction worker's hands holding an iPhone at a residential jobsite. Wood framing visible in background. The worker taps to record, speaks briefly into the phone.

Pull back to reveal: A professional daily report on the screen, the worker nods approvingly and taps "Send."

## Technical Notes for Sora

### Visual Style Guidelines
- **Color palette:** Warm earth tones for jobsite, cool blue for UI/tech elements
- **Lighting:** Golden hour preferred for emotional shots, bright daylight for feature demos
- **Camera:** Mix of handheld documentary and smooth stabilized shots
- **Depth of field:** Shallow when featuring phone/app, deeper for environmental shots

### Construction Authenticity Checklist
- Hard hats and high-vis vests on all workers
- Realistic jobsite clutter (lumber, tools, materials)
- Dusty/worn appearance on clothing
- Residential construction (wood framing, not commercial steel)
- Mix of trades visible (framing, electrical, plumbing)

### What to Avoid
- Overly clean/staged construction sites
- Perfect hair and makeup on workers
- Generic stock footage feel
- Cheesy smile-at-camera moments
- Over-the-top tech effects

## Suggested Music/Audio

**For hero video:**
- Uplifting indie/folk acoustic (think: Mumford & Sons style)
- Or: Modern electronic with organic elements
- Key: Hopeful but not cheesy

**For feature videos:**
- Clean, minimal electronic
- Subtle whoosh/click sounds for UI interactions

**For testimonial:**
- Minimal/no music, natural ambient sound
- Let authenticity speak
